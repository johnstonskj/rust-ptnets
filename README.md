# Project ptnets

This repository contains a set of Rust crates for the modeling and simulation of Place/Transition nets.

## Crates

- `ptnet-core` ([readme](https://github.com/johnstonskj/rust-ptnets/tree/main/ptnet-core)) -- provides the core types and traits for modeling and simulating Place/Transition nets.
* `ptnet-elementary` ([readme](https://github.com/johnstonskj/rust-ptnets/tree/main/ptnet-elementary)) -- provides an implementation of the `ptnet-core` traits for Elementary nets (EN).

Additionally the crate `tree-sitter-ptnet` allows for structured editing of PTNet files.
